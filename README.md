This project is a simple markdown to HTML compiler made in Ruby.
Done by following the blog [Writing a Markdown Compiler](https://blog.beezwax.net/writing-a-markdown-compiler/), the idea is to expand the initial code to support more markdown features, and learn more about Ruby (and how compilers work) in the process.
It's basically divided in three parts: Tokenizer, Parser and Generator. And also one test for each part.
